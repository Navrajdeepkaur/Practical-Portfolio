# week1
Doing the task of week 1 practical gave a clear and basic idea about HTML, css and javascipt . With help of all the three I designed a simple yet functional web page. The programming language web page is developed to see the important languages which are used by developers to build websites . Further I added a column to make a checklist for the work they are doing or they want to do . It is called as "to do list". A user can simple add content to the list and click on add . Once the task is done the user can cut the certain task from the to do list by clicking on the checkbox provided right next to it.
